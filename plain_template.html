	<div class="body-story">

		<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP, has been adopted in all 50 states across the United States. Among the states with the highest number of SNAP beneficiaries is New York, falling at <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/food-stamp-benefits-by-state">number three</a> on the list.</p>

		<p>To begin to understand the need of the program, the program itself must be defined. <a href="https://www.ny.gov/services/apply-snap">SNAP</a> is carried out by issuing “electronic benefits that can be used like cash to purchase food,” according to New York State. The program is on an eligibility basis requiring applicants to apply. Eligibility, based on income, is dependent on household size and (dis)ability.</p>

		<p>Though a statewide issue, it is evident that the county of which Syracuse belongs to faces a food justice issue. <a href="https://map.feedingamerica.org/county/2019/overall/new-york/county/onondaga">Onondaga County</a> has a food insecurity rate of 11.1 percent with 51,580 people falling under this percentage. In the county, there exists <a href="http://www.ongov.net/health/documents/OnondagaCountyCHA-CHIP.pdf">less than one third as many grocery stores</a> as there does fast food restaurants. The result: a food desert.</p>

		<p>Broadly, a food desert is constituted as an area with limited access to affordable and healthy food. Specifically, the United States Department of Agriculture defines a <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf">food desert</a> as a community where the poverty rate is greater than or equal to 20 percent and where 33 percent or more of residents are more than one mile or ten miles—in urban and rural settings, respectively—from the nearest supermarket. In Syracuse alone, <a href="http://www.ongov.net/health/documents/OnondagaCountyCHA-CHIP.pdf">over 50 percent of census tracts</a> are defined as a food desert.</p>

		<p>SNAP strives to alleviate this.</p>

		<p>The program’s popularity sped up in 2008 due to the Great Recession; the amount of households receiving permanent assistance steadily rose after. By 2009, the program applied to over double the amount of households in 2002.</p> 

		<p>After a peak in 2014 with over three times as many permanent households in 2002, the non-temporary household rate began to drop. Though it never reached pre-Recession numbers. And it doesn’t seem that that will happen any time soon.</p>

		<p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced many into financial hardship. For those already experiencing it, the hardship worsened. Those unable to transform their home into their workplace, it often meant loss of livelihood. </p>

		<p>Students were forced to stay home. Though much of the focus of the educational changes made during the pandemic relate to academic performance, socialization, and overall mental health, accessibility to food was often left out. </p>

		<p>Students dependent on food services provided by their schools were forced to become dependent on sources from home that did not exist. </p>
